# RL
##Reading Group on Reinforcement Learning topics
##NYU, Fall 2016

###Logistics 
  - Meetings run every **Wednesday at 9h30** (before the CILVR lab meeting), at the large conference room at 715/719 Broadway 12th floor. Breakfast will be provided.
  - Paper discussion + Paper review plan: Each week we will assign one or two papers to volunteers who will present it following week. During the reading/presentation, we will edit a review of the paper which will be posted here. [also subject to change].
  - Guest speakers. We will try to invite RL experts (e.g. G. Tesauro) with some frequency.
  - Other communication channels ( Facebook groups?, Slack? ) [TBD].
  
###Organization
The RG is initially organized by J.Bruna, K. Cho, S. Sukhbaatar, K. Ross, D. Sontag, with help from the rest of the CILVR group.
